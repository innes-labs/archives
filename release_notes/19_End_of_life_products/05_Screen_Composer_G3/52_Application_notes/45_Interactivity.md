# Interactivity

The goal of this application note is to explain how to make interactive a media in Screen Composer G3.

The interactivity is a behavior option which can be activated when the media is inserted in the playout.

That applies to :

- PDF medias
- PowerPoint medias
- Playlist medias
- Playfolder medias

That permits with a user key press for example to:

- go to the next page for PDF and PowerPoint medias,
- play the next medias inside a playlist or the next media inside a playfolder.

Ensure that your device is properly supporting the user interactivity.

#### **SUMMARY** `2019-10-29` (last update)

##### **INFORMATION**
Insert the media into your playout. With a right click, choose the ```Interactivity``` option. And publish.

Warning: when using Playzilla 4.XX.YY, it is required to run a playout script `Scrollbar restore` to display the scroll bar along the Web page if wished. For further information refer to the appropriate playout script release note.
