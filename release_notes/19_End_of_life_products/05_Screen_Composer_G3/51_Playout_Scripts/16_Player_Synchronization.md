# Player synchronization
*RELEASE NOTE*

- The goal of this application note is to explain how to configure the SMA300 players to synchronize eachother, so that they can play the same video content exactly at the same time even when
	- one of the player reboots or
	- one of the player content is updated

>##### **IMPORTANT**
- Previous script may be not compatible so please take care to update all the synchronized players with the same version of the script
- Never use this script for other topic than screen wall (with only one video played by player) else unexpected bad side effects should be noticed
>##### **BUG FIX, NEW FEATURES, MINOR UPDATES**
- Change: in case publication or player reboot, the player starts with black screen (avoiding video cut at the resynchronization)
