# Maintenance of devices having Flash WebUI
*RELEASE NOTE*

In early 2021, some Web browsers may not be able to open Web page containing Flash, including Web configuration interface ot these devices:

- Gekkota OS G3
- Gekkota RT G3
- Gekkota RT G4

To work around, a Qeedji solution is proposed to continue to support Flash Web configuration interfaces by using another product than a Web browser: [Gekkota Desktop G4](https://www.qeedji.tech/en/support/index.php?Gekkota_G4_for_device/Gekkota_Desktop_for_Windows)
