# Qether
*RELEASE NOTE*

`Qether`, or *Qeedji Ethernet Tools*, is a CLI (Command Line Interface) program running on `MS-Windows` able to send private Ethernet frames through a specified Ethernet network interface.

It allows to:

- list the Ethernet network interfaces available on your computer,
- list the Qeedji devices available in a given Ethernet network,
- get the system information from a device,
- update the firmware version of a device by sending a `.bin` firmware,
- update the configuration of a device by sending a `.js` configuration script,
- send a reboot command to a device.

**Before sending a `.js` configuration script on your device or using the discover Qether command, ensure that your application has been upgraded with a suitable application version shown in the compatibility chapter.**

>##### **BUG FIX, NEW FEATURES, MINOR UPDATES**
- Add support for `discover` Qether command for SBL10e device embedding the application with version 1.10.15 (or above)
- Add support for firmware version printing in the console when launching `discover` Qether command
- Add support for `.js` configuration file for `configure` Qether command

#INFORMATION
***********************************************************************
#### **DOCUMENTATION**
- `Qether` user manual (1.12.10-001A/EN) [download](https://github.com/innes-labs/archives/downloads/sbl10e/qether/qether-user_manual-1.12.10-001A_en.pdf)
- In case using the `configuration` command, use the `.js` file suitable for your device.
#### **ONE COMMAND AT A TIME**
When using `Qether` tool to update the firmware version for several devices at a time, thanks to a MS-Windows batch, it is recommended to execute the `Qether` commands the one after the other.
#### **WINPCAP**
`WinPcap` 4.1.3 (Windows packet capture library):
- If `WinPcap` is not yet present, it is automatically installed by the `Qether` installer,
- At the last step of `WinPcap` setup, please leave the checkbox *Automatically start the WinPcap driver at boot time* checked.
#### **WLAN INTERFACE**
- The `Qether` tool cannot work on WLAN interface of your computer.
#### **CONFIGURE ERROR**
The sending of `prefs.json` configuration file with Qether V1.12.10 (and above) returns this error explaining that only the .js configuration are now supported (and not the .json anymore): *Parsing arguments failed: Invalid extension for configuration file. A JavaScript file is expected, with '.js' extension*.
#### **CONFIGURE**
Sending a `.js` configuration script on a older application version may imply factory settings on this device.
