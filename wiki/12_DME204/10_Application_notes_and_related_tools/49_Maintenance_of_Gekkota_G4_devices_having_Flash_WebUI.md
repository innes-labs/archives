# Maintenance of devices having Flash WebUI
*RELEASE NOTE*

In early 2021, some Web browsers may not be able anymore to open Web pages supporting *Flash* technology, including the Web configuration interface of the `Gekkota RT G4` devices.

To work around, instead of using a Web browser, it is proposed to use the [Gekkota Desktop G4](https://www.qeedji.tech/en/support/index.php?Gekkota_G4_for_device/Gekkota_Desktop_for_Windows) product allowing to deal with configuration Web interfaces supporting *Flash* technology.
