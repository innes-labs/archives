#### **AUDIO INACTIVATION**
- Some rare DVB-T receiver or UDP streaming receiver may not be able to play properly the DME204 UDP stream when audio is inactivated. To work around in this case, activate the audio with the DME204 WebUI
#### **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**
- Not supported anymore
	- SWF medias
	- .ppt and *.pps medias
- Not yet supported
	- Infrared
	- Jack35 GPIO out
- Media Source Extension
	- In this version, the playback of all other MSE contents playbacks, meaning MSE video content displayed in an area inside the HTML page, without any device reboot is not guaranteed
	- About the ```Media `Source Extension``` Javascript:
        - Each MSE content provider has its own algorithm implementation in its MSE Javascript. Consequently, it is possible that some MSE content having a specific MSE Javascript is not fully supported making that the video does not start properly (for example, with some MSE video content replay)
        - When playing a MSE content, an error message *if playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device* could be displayed sometimes after a while telling that the video has stopped and will not start anymore. To work around, play another media, then play again the MSE content. The best practise consists in playing the MSE content URI with a fixed duration (ex: duration 1 hour).
    - About other MSE content: for example, the MSE video content displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page:
        - Warning: the MSE content provider can decide at any time to remove a content. So an MSE content can be available one day and not available the day after
        - When the MSE content is displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page, a lot of other objects need to be displayed as well and could require a lot of memory. Depending on the Web page played, the device could sometimes reboot after having played it after a while. The `W3C` is working on to improve the `Media Source Extensions` specifications so that the MSE Javascript is more suitable also for devices that have a limited available memory amount
    - To inactivate the DASH MSE feature,
        - Set the user preference ```media.mediasource.enable``` to ```false```. The error message *An error occurred. Please try again later (Playback ID: ...)* should be displayed when trying ten to play an MSE content in this condition. This message could be seen also when playing another video at the same time while the dual video decoding is not supported on this device.
- Not yet supported in MS-PowerPoint medias rendering:
    - Animation
    - Effects
           - WordArt, shadow
    - Images
           - Image with filtering
           - Emf
    - Animated image
           - Gif & Png (displayed but not animated)
    - Some shapes
        - Smart Art
        - Multi-colours shape texture
    - Text
        - Kerning is not supported
    - Audio & video
    - Vertical fading (in case mixed horizontal & vertical fading)
    - Font
        - Embedded (the font needs to be embedded in the playout manifest)
        - Fail over & substitution fonts
        - some characters whose fonts is 32 bits may be not displayed (ex: fontawesome.ttf)
    - OLE injection (MS objects)
    - Slide hiding

- In case the device does not manage to install the Gekkota G4 middleware, contact support@qeedji.tech to double check that your DME204 device is fully compatible for the migration
>##### **BUG FIX, NEW FEATURES, MINOR UPDATES**
- Add support for a scheme list in WebUI *Configuration > Output* in *Ethernet* output mode
    - `udp://`
    - `rtp://`
    - `rtmp://`
	    - `Server address`
		    - for example: a.rtmp.youtube.com/live3
	    - `Key`
		    - for example: 1t7h-py6d-p9qw-881
- Add support for scrolling text with overlay
    - note 1: to have the best rendering, set the output mode frequency to the maximal one: 60 Hz
    - note 2: to support properly the scrolling text overlay, thanks to keep the same output mode frequency for the receiver devices (ex: *1920x1080 @ 60 Hz*) as for the DME204 encoder/streamer (ex: *1280x720 @ 60 Hz*)
    - check that the monitor connected to the receiver devices are properly supporting the frequency set
- Add support for remote file with the scheme ```smb://```
    - Supported protocol: *SMB/CIFS 1.0*
    - URL example: ```smb://<computer_ip_addr>/video.mp4```
		- Some Windows OS version may not support the SMB/CIFS 1.0 by default. For further information, read the [CIFS V1.0 activation on MS-Windows 10 application note](http://www.innes.pro/fr/support/index.php?Third_part_documentation_and_tools/CIFS_V1.0_activation_on_MS-Windows_10)

    - ```Very highly optimized```
    - ```Highly optimized```
    - ```Moderately optimized```
    - ```Nominal Mode```
    - Associated user preference for energy manager task: ```innes.power-manager.calendar``` (JSON value)
- Change: the brandname moves from `Innes` to `Qeedji`
- Change: the WebUI logo Qeedji is supporting a button to return to the Web page ```http://<device_ip_addr>/.playout/```
- Change the WebUI look for the WebDAV directories ```http://<device_ip_addr>/<directory>/```
    - with ```<directory>``` = ```.admin```, ```.extension```, ```.log```, ```.playlog```, ```.playout```, ```.resources```, ```.software```, ```.status```, ```.upnp```
- Change the Web browser tab title when connecting to the device WebUI:
    - Title: `<MODEL> (<Hostname>)`
    - Pictogram: black gecko
- Change: the MS-PowerPoint default background is not transparent by default anymore
- Change: some fonts was not rendered properly leading to unexpected line break (MS-PowerPoint, PDF, ...)
- Fix: in some streaming conditions, the playout background could be black color instead being the right one
- Fix: after having installed a certificate with a configuration script, sometimes it was not possible anymore to connect to the device in https or to add a new certificate.
    - if the previous case occurs in this version, the certificate list is cleared once then the issue should not occur anymore. Think to add back the missing certificate after the  device reboot.
    - if the previous case occurs in this version while the test card is displayed, a message *Cryptographic database corrupted, please reboot for repairing* is displayed. The device needs to be restarted (WebUI, or electrical unplug)
- Fix: sometimes some MS-PowerPoint transitions could be unexpectedly jerky when CEC was activated
- Fix: in some rare case the background colour of Playzilla could be the wrong one

                - ```https://www.youtube.com/embed/<YouTube_video_uuid>?autoplay=1```
            - The Web TV channels available in full screen are available for download in the *content models and uri models packs* delivered the 3rd of October 2018

    - The server DASH Live and the DME204 device need to be on time and synchronized with a NTP server
    - For video with high rate, in case the video is stopping after a while, it could be needed to increase the ```media.cache_size``` from *16364* KB (default size) to *65536* KB
