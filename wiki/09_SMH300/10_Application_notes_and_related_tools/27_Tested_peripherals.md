#### **INFORMATION**
- About HDMI-Input
    - To know the HDMI-input usage conditions, refer to DMB400 release note
    - The peripherals HDMI-input with HDCP activated are not yet supported
        - note that, by example, HDCP is often activated on DVD player
- About the `HDHR4-2DT DVB-T to HTTP streamer`
    - Connect to the streamer Web interface and launch ```Channel Lineup``` / ```Detect channels``` then get the ```<channel number>``` of the channel to view
    - Play the url:
        - ```http://<IP_adress>```:5004/auto/v```<channel number>```
    - In case the signal is too low, a message *video can't be played because the file is corrupted* is displayed. After the signal comes back, the video is not displayed again. You need to publish again or play again the url

        - with ```<n>```: ```0``` to play the main stream (default), ```1``` to play the secondary stream
    - `DAHUA IPC-HFW2300R-Z versus DME204`
        - Warning: in case several clients are playing the same RTSP channel, it is recommended to not install the DME204 behind cascaded switchs, because some of them may prevent to receive the RTSP properly. To work around, install the DME204 close to the network head.
- About the `Pi 4 Model B  & DVB TV µHAT`
    - Waiting that TVheadend is supporting officially the DVB-T to UDP gateway feature, Innes is proposing a temporary software solution [TVheadend_4.3-InnesPatched1](https://www.innes.pro/en/support/index.php?Third_part_documentation_and_tools/TVHeadend_4.3-Innespatched1) which is supporting it.
