- Fix: in some cases, after a scene transition in an audio channel, the content of the previous scene was not stopped properly, so more than one audio media could be played at the same time

- Fix: when a scene was over and no scene was scheduled just after, the App was still displaying the background content of the scene instead of displaying the default colour when no content is played
