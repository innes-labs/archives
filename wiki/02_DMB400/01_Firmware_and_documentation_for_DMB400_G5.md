#### **INFORMATION**
- Mouse pointer 
    - The mouse pointer is only supported when working with a touch screen monitor  
- Monitor monitoring    
    - Some unexpected device reboot could be noticed when monitor monitoring is made on the wrong video input (when monitoring HDMI1 while cable is plugged on HDMI2)
#### **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**
- Media Source Extension
    - In this version, the playback of all other MSE contents playbacks, meaning MSE video content displayed in an area inside the HTML page, without any device reboot is not guaranteed
    - About the ```Media Source Extension``` JavaScript:  
        - Each MSE content provider has its own algorithm implementation in its MSE JavaScript. Consequently, it is possible that some MSE content having a specific MSE JavaScript is not fully supported making that the video does not start properly (for example, with some MSE video content replay)       
        - When playing a MSE content, an error message *if playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device* could be displayed sometimes after a while, telling that the video has stopped and will not start anymore. To work around, play another media, then play again the MSE content. The best practise consists in playing the MSE content URI with a fixed duration (ex: duration 1 hour). 
    - About other MSE content: for example, the MSE video content displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page:
        - Warning: the MSE content provider can decide at any time to remove a content. So an MSE content can be available one day and not available the day after   
        - When the MSE content is displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page, a lot of other objects need to be displayed as well and could require a lot of memory. Depending on the Web page played, the device could sometimes reboot after having played it after a while. The `W3C` is working on to improve the `Media Source Extensions` specifications so that the MSE Javascript is more suitable also for devices that have a limited available memory amount        
    - To inactivate the DASH MSE feature, 
        - Set the user preference ```media.mediasource.enable``` to ```false```. The error message *An error occurred. Please try again later (Playback ID: ...)* should be displayed when trying ten to play an MSE content in this condition. This message could be seen also when playing another video at the same time when the dual video decoding is not supported on this device
- H265-60Hz
    - When playing H265 60Hz video, it is advised to configure the display output with a 60Hz mode   
- HDMI-input  
    - When rotation 90°, 180°, 270° is activated, the HDMI-input is not supported and a message *content temporarily unavailable* is displayed    
    - HDMI-input content playback is not supported when the user preference ```innes.video.renderer.default``` is set to the value ```gpu```. To support it, change the user preference value to ```overlay```
    - Some rare skip frame could be noticed on HDMI-input content zone when playing several medias at the same time
    - Some rare skip frame could be noticed on HDMI-input content when there is audio on HDMI-input
