##### **TVHEADEND: GET VERSION**
To know the ```TVheadend``` version, in the ```TVheadend``` GUI, go to the menu *About*.
The version is ```Tvheadend 4.3-InnesPatched1```

#### **TVHEADEND 4.3-INNESPATCH1: CUSTOM COMMAND TO START ONE OR SEVERAL UDP STREAMS**
To start streaming a TV channel over UDP, enter the following URL in a Web browser:
```http://<raspberrypi_ip_addr>:9981/udpstream/start/channelnumber/<local_channel_number>?address=<udp_dest_addr>&port=<udp_port>```

With
```
<raspberrypi_ip_addr> = IP address of the Raspberry Pi main board
<local_channel_number> = local channel number of the TV channel
<udp_dest_addr> = destination IP address of the UDP stream. It can be a multicast address
<udp_port> = UDP destination port
```

You can find the local channel number of your service in the ```TVheadend``` GUI in the menu ```Configuration > DVB Inputs > Services``` [view example](https://github.com/innes-labs/archives/downloads/third-part-tools/raspberry-pi_patches/TVheadend_local_channel_number.jpg)

It is possible to start several UDP stream at a time with the conditions that the service to stream are hosted on the same multiplex:

For example:

```
http://192.168.1.133:9981/udpstream/start/channelnumber/21?address=224.1.1.1&port=1111
```
Then
```
http://192.168.1.133:9981/udpstream/start/channelnumber/22?address=225.1.1.2&port=1112
```

To check the number of opened UDP streams, go to the menu ```Status > Connections```. There is one line per opened UDP stream.

#### **TVHEADEND 4.3-INNESPATCH1: CUSTOM COMMAND TO STOP A UDP STREAM**
To stop an UDP stream, enter the following URL in a Web browser:
```
http://<raspberrypi_ip_addr>:9981/udpstream/stop/channelnumber/<local_channel_number>?address=<udp_dest_addr>&port=<udp_port>
```
For example:
```
http://192.168.1.133:9981/udpstream/stop/channelnumber/21?address=224.1.1.1&port=1111
```

#### **TVHEADEND 4.3-INNESPATCH1: START A UDP STREAM AUTOMATICALLY AFTER BOOTING UP**
To start automatically an UDP stream as soon as Raspberry Pi boot has reboot, you have to modify the custom file ```/lib/systemd/system/tvheadend.service```:

Open a terminal window, and enter the appropriate command like explained.

Change the file read/write permissions:
```
sudo chmod a+w /lib/systemd/system/tvheadend.service
```

Edit the file ```/lib/systemd/system/tvheadend.service``` and uncomment the following line:
```
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/curl "http://127.0.0.1:9981/udpstream/start/channelnumber/<local_channel_number>?address=<udp_dest_addr>&port=<udp_port>"
```
Replace the values to match your data, with:
```
<local_channel_number> = local channel number of the TV channel
<udp_dest_addr> = destination IP address of the UDP stream. It can be a multicast address
<udp_port> = UDP destination port
```

For example,
```
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/curl "http://127.0.0.1:9981/udpstream/start/channelnumber/25?address=224.1.2.5&port=1235"
```

**TVheadend HTTP server readiness delay**:

If the connection does not start automatically, that means that:

- either the ```DVB TV uHAT tuner``` is not locked. In this case, check the stream status
- or the HTTP server was not yet ready to receive the HTTP command. To increase the delay before declaring that the TVheadend HTTP server is ready to receive HTTP command, change the value in seconds (ex: 20 seconds instead of 10 seconds by default).
```
ExecStartPort=/bin/sleep 20
```
Warning: Some TVheadend background tasks like the *initial EPG Grab at startup* or the network *start-up scan* may delay also the TVheadend HTTP server readiness of several minutes. When they are running, these background tasks appear in the table of the TVheadend menu ```Status > Subscription```. It is advised to inactivate them so that the feature TVheadend DVB-T to UDP can run immediately after boot-up. For further information, read the appropriate appendix below. If you want to keep these background tasks anyway, you can enjoy to fine tune upper value for this delay.

Save the file ```/lib/systemd/system/tvheadend.service``` and reboot the Raspberry Pi.

#### **TVHEADEND: APPENDIX TO RELAUNCH A DVB-T MULTIPLEX SCANNING**
- Go to the ```TVheadend``` menu ```Configuration > DVB Inputs > TV Adapters``` and check the parameters

	- You can see the list of found multiplex (call also muxes)
- Go to the ```TVheadend``` menu ```Configuration > DVB Inputs > Services```
	- You can see the list of found services on the different multiplex scanned with success
	- Press on the button `Map services`
		- For example:
			- *Basic settings*
				- *Services*: let as default (ex: `DVB-T Network/473.833MHz/F3....`
				- *Map encrypted services*: true
				- *Merge same name*: false
				- *Use fuzzy mapping if merging same name*: false
				- *Tidy the channel name such as removing trailing HD text*: false
			- *Advanced settings*
				- *Check availablility*: false
				- *Create type-based tags*: true
				- *Create provider name tags*: true
				- *Create network names tags*: true
