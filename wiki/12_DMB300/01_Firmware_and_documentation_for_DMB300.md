# Firmware and documentation for DMB300
*RELEASE NOTE*

**IMPORTANT: one specific license key is required per each DMB300 device that must run on Gekkota 5 middleware.**

**IMPORTANT: After migration, in case using third party software to publish App, your previous Apps may be not compatible. For further information, contact support@qeedji.tech**

**IMPORTANT: In case you wish to upgrade your DMB300 devices from Gekkota 3 middleware (3.12.57) to Gekkota 5 middleware (5.YY.ZZ), it is highly recommended to contact support@qeedji.tech to know the impact of this migration. Check also the following software compatibilities, and remember that you cannot downgrade to a Gekkota 3 middleware afterwards. The specific DMB300 RMA (or Return Merchandise Authorization) consisting in downgrading the middleware Gekkota 5 back to the middleware Gekkota 3 is not covered by the warranty of the device.**

*Never make electric unplug on your player while software upgrade is in progress (green led blinking 6 times every 4 seconds) else the player may not be able to work properly*
