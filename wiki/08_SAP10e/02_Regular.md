# Regular for SAP10e
*RELEASE NOTE*

Once paired to up to 10 SLATEs, the **Regular** application allows to:

- update the content of up to 10 SLATE devices by using `Qeedji PowerPoint publisher for SLATE` or by dropping .ppk contents in the WebDAV directories from a WebDAV client,

- Fix: in some case, the firmware upload could fail when done with the Web user interface
- Fix: in some rare case, the device should be unplugged from the Ethernet wall plug then plugged again to work properly
- Fix: setting as static IP address, the same IP address value as the one previously given by DHCP prevent the user to connect to the device Web user interface after the device reboot
- Fix: when a SLATE was previously paired to another SAP10e device, it was possible to pair it for a while but it was disappearing afterwards in less than 15 minutes
