# Firmware and documentation for SMA300
*RELEASE NOTE*

**IMPORTANT: In case you wish to upgrade your SMA300 devices from Gekkota 3 middleware (3.12.XX) to Gekkota 4 middleware (4.1X.YY), it is highly recommended to contact support@qeedji.tech to know the impact of this migration. Check also the following software compatibilities, and remember that you won’t be allowed to downgrade to a Gekkota 3 middleware afterwards. The specific SMA300 RMA (or Return Merchandise Authorization) consisting in downgrading the middleware Gekkota 4 back to the middleware Gekkota 3 is not covered by the warranty of the device**

*Never make electric unplug on your player while software upgrade is in progress (green led blinking 6 times every 4 seconds) else the player may not be able to work properly*

#### **INFORMATION**
- Mouse pointer
    - The mouse pointer is only supported when working with a touch screen monitor
- Monitor monitoring
    - Some unexpected player reboot could be noticed when monitor monitoring is made on the wrong video input (when monitoring HDMI1 while cable is plugged on HDMI2)
#### **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**
- Not supported
    - Player synchronization
    - AVI container
    - inter-media transitions & zone exit transitions
    - Bitrate limitation
    - Colour adjustment
- Anomaly
    - In case the WWAN option is activated, the video decoding through UDP in multicast is not supported
- Media Source Extension
    - In this version, the playback of all other MSE contents playbacks, meaning MSE video content displayed in an area inside the HTML page, without any device reboot is not guaranteed
    - About the ```Media Source Extension``` JavaScript:
        - Each MSE content provider has its own algorithm implementation in its MSE JavaScript. Consequently, it is possible that some MSE content having a specific MSE JavaScript is not fully supported making that the video does not start properly (for example, with some MSE video content replay)
        - When playing a MSE content, an error message *if playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device* could be displayed sometimes after a while telling that the video has stopped and will not start anymore. To work around, play another media, then play again the MSE content. The best practise consists in playing the MSE content URI with a fixed duration (ex: duration 1 hour).
    - About other MSE content: for example, the MSE video content displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page:
        - Warning: the MSE content provider can decide at any time to remove a content. So an MSE content can be available one day and not available the day after
        - When the MSE content is displayed in a thumbnail inside the HTML Web page, a lot of other objects need to be displayed as well and could require a lot of memory. Depending on the Web page played, the device could sometimes reboot after having played it after a while. The `W3C` is working on to improve the `Media Source Extensions` specifications so that the MSE Javascript is more suitable also for devices that have a limited available memory amount
    - To inactivate the DASH MSE feature,
        - Set the user preference ```media.mediasource.enable``` to ```false```. The error message *An error occurred. Please try again later (Playback ID: ...)* should be displayed when trying ten to play an MSE content in this condition. This message could be seen also when playing another video at the same time when the dual video decoding is not supported on this device.
