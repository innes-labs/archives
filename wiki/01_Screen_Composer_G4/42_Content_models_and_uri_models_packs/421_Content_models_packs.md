#### **REGIONALITY**
Some content models may requires to set the appropriate regionality in the device Web user interface so that:

- some labels are translated automatically in the regionality language and
- the date and time values are displayed in the country format
#### TXTFILE HSCROLLER
The *summary* and/or the *description* field of the event can be also displayed for events that have not yet started only when the .ics file has appropriate alarm

After an App publication, the first line of the first run of the scrolling text may be not rendered with the right font on Gekkota 3 and Gekkota 4 middleware
#### **CONTENT-MODELS INSTALLATION OR UPGRADING**
For further information about content model pack installation or content model upgrade, refer to the Screen Composer user manual.
#### RSS
Setting a wrong charset in the form may prevent the mask to display the news. If not sure, uncheck the charset checkbox, and try again
#### AC3 REAL ESTATE
On UHD monitors, the images of the real estate advertisings may be not displayed with the right size
#### WEATHER
The logger for this mask is *widget.meteored_weather*.<br>
For a weather forecast off-line demo:

- set the Identifier field to 0000,
- add the appropriate <town_name_in_lower_case>.xml file in a `/weather` directory located at the root of the weather widget,
- change the couple of the date values and of the week days values inside each .xml file according to the day today. For example:

```<day value="20220502" name="Lundi">
../..
<day value="20220503" name="Mardi">```

- add the `/weather` directory as linked medias of the widget
- to get the weather xml file for a specific town, connect to the meteored portal with your account, select a town (called localization). Copy-paste the URL below the title `XML file with 5-day forecasts (information at 3-hour intervals)` (e.g. `http://api.tameteo.com/index.php?api_lang=fr&localidad=1200&affiliate_id=55ruwdqubp34&v=2.0`) in your Web browser and press enter. Download the xml file.

#### CALENDAR COUNTDOWN
The *Calendar countdown* displays a time countdown value, with one second accuracy, when the next event occurrence is in less than 365 days in the future.
An option allows to define the time countdown value *accuracy*:

- *Second* (default), i.e.: *1 day 25 hours 56 minutes 10 seconds*
- *Minute*, i.e.: *1 day 25 hours 56 minutes*
    - if the *Calendar countdown* value is less than 1 minute, the next event is considered as imminent
- *Hour*, i.e.: *1 day 25 hours*
    - if the *Calendar countdown* value is less than 1 hour, the next event is considered as imminent
- *Day*: i.e. *1 day*
    - if the *Calendar countdown* is running the D-day, the next event is considered as imminent

There is 2 main modes:

- *Date and time* mode: the *Calendar countdown* displays a time countdown until the programmed *Date and time* value. Depending on whether the *Date and time* is imminent (depends on the selected accuracy) or just reached (*[00] days [00] hour [00] minute [00] second*), the *Calendar countdown* can display an optional specific content for a while before quitting. Once done, the *Calendar countdown* quits automatically. When over, if the *Calendar countdown* is played again, the *Calendar countdown* displays nothing and quit.
- *Calendar variable* mode: (check that the variable manager is supported by your Screen Composer G4 version) when using a *calendar variable* allowing to define a slots start-time/end time, slots validity date and slots recurrency, the *Calendar countdown* displays the time countdown until the next occurrence. When the start time of the next slot occurrence is reached, the *Calendar countdown* reaches *[00] days [00] hour [00] minute [00] second* and quit. Depending on whether the start time of the next occurrence is imminent (depends on the selected accuracy) or just reached, the *Calendar countdown* can display an optional specific content for a while before quitting. If the *Calendar countdown* is played again, the *Calendar countdown* evaluates whether there is a new next slot occurrence. If yes, the *Calendar countdown* displays the time countdown until the next occurrence again and so on. If not, the *Calendar countdown* displays nothing and quit.

It is advised that the device is on time, with its system clock synchronized through a NTP time server.<br>The form is not translated for Spanish and Russian languages.
