# Firmware and documentation for SMT210
*RELEASE NOTE*

**IMPORTANT: In case you wish to upgrade your SMT210 devices from  Gekkota G3 middleware (3.12.XX) to Gekkota G4 middleware (4.11.1X), it is recommended to contact support@qeedji.tech to know the impact of this migration. Check also the software compatibilities below, and remember that you wonâ€™t be allowed to downgrade to a Gekkota G3 middleware afterwards. The specific SMT210 RMA (or Return Merchandise Authorization) consisting in downgrading the middleware Gekkota 4 back to the middleware Gekkota G3 is not covered by the warranty of the device**

*Never make electric unplug on your player while software upgrade is in progress (green led blinking 6 times every 4 seconds) else the player may not be able to work properly*
