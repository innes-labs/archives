# Fail soft mode

#### **SUMMARY**
- The *Fail soft mode* feature permits to stop playing device content when some instability is detected (several unexpected player reboots happen in few minutes).
- When the player is in Fail Soft mode,
	- A specific *Fail soft mode* pop-up is displayed on the screen
	- The green led (at the back of the player) is blinking by following a specific sequence

- To return to *Normal mode*, new publishing is required (attention: most of time, unexpected reboots are certainly due to a specific media inserted in the playout and not supported by the player (it can be an audio-video media, or any other media), so it is advised to look for the wrong media and remove it before publishing again)

- The *Fail soft mode* is a security feature implemented in Gekkota_os (except LCAN & EEEBOX) since Gekkota 3.12.15. For security reasons, the fail soft mode feature is automatic and can not be removed from the player
