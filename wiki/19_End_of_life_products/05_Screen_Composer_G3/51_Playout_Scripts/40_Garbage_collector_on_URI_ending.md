# Garbage collector on URI ending

#### **SUMMARY**
Some Web page viewed properly on PC computers owning a large amount of volatile memory may not be played after a while when played several time on a device. To work around, running this playout script is forcing the device the free the memory previously required each time the playing of the Web page has ended.
