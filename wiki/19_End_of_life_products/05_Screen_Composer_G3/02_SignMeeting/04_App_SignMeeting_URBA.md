#### **DOCUMENTATION**
- User manual (006A_EN) [download](https://github.com/innes-labs/archives/downloads/app-signmeeting-urba/signmeeting-urba-calendar-user-manual-006A_en.pdf)
#### **CSS FILE FOR TAB STYLE**
- CSS File V1.10.12 [download](https://github.com/innes-labs/archives/downloads/application-notes-signmeeting/theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css)
#### **UPGRADE VERSION**
- Version upgrading is only possible since 1.10.51
- In order to upgrade:
	- open Screen Composer,
		- click on SignMeeting link to configure the app
		- make a modification (ex Title) and
		- click on "finish" button
		- click again on SignMeeting link (version modification should be noticed)
#### **DATASOURCE HOSTED ON DISTANT SERVER**
- Some slowness could be noticed when booking (or cancelling) a meeting in case datasource is referring to distant server with poor reaction capability
#### **NOTE WHEN FORMULAR CAN NOT BE OPENED IN SCREEN COMPOSER**
- In some rare case (seen most of the time after version upgrading), the SignMeeting formular could not be opened in Screen Composer, and a message is displaying: *An error occured while opening the interface*. To solve the issue close and open again Screen Composer
#### **NOTE FOR ATTACHMENTS**
- URBA calendar does not support attachment
#### **NOTE WHEN PLAYER IS FACING ISSUE TO CONNECT URBA SYSTEM**
- In case the player INNES does not manage to resolve domain (for example https://societedugrandparis-formation.urbaonline.com/), SignMeeting raises a message *A problem occured during the initial server connection / Details: xhr.status 0*. To solve the issue, in the player WebUI, configure server DNS with Google DNS server and try again
	- Prefered primary DNS server: 8.8.8.8
	- Prefered secondary DNS server: 8.8.8.4
#### **NEXT MEEETING TO CURRENT MEETING**
- In some rare cases, event pass from next meeting to current meeting in late. If the occurence of this problem is annoying, decrease datasource/refresh time to workaround
#### **NOTE FOR CSS CLASS**
- CSS file need to be configure to suport CSS class
	- (if required double check relative path of picture in theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css)
	- rename if required the .cusClass1 into the name you want
	- choose API inside
		- background-image or background-color
		- Note: CSS is compliant with Mozilla CSS background API (W3C)
			- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background
				- background-image
				- background-position
				- background-size
				- background-repeat
				- background-origin
				- background-clip
				- background-attachment
				- background-color
	- for example:
     	- The file theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css is situated in a sub-directory *css* (./css/theme_sm.css)
     	- The file background picture is situated in a sub-directory *images* (./images/diagonal3.png)
      	- Relative path has to be in this case
	      	- ```background-image: url("../images/diagonal3.png");```
	      	   (go up to CSS file parent directory and then go to *images* directory
- Match SignMeeting *device/edit/CSS class* value with a value of your theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css
	- for example, when ```.cusClass1``` is present on theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css
		- enter ```cusClass1``` in *device/edit/CSS class* field
- Add the required media *./images/diagonal3.png* in Screen Composer manifest (*medias* tab)
