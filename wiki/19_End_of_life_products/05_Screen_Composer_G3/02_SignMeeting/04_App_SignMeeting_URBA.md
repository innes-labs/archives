#### **NOTE WHEN FORMULAR CAN NOT BE OPENED IN SCREEN COMPOSER**

- In case the player INNES does not manage to resolve domain (for example https://societedugrandparis-formation.urbaonline.com/), SignMeeting raises a message *A problem occured during the initial server connection / Details: xhr.status 0*. To solve the issue, in the player WebUI, configure server DNS with Google DNS server and try again
	- Prefered primary DNS server: 8.8.8.8
	- Prefered secondary DNS server: 8.8.8.4   
#### **NEXT MEEETING TO CURRENT MEETING**
- In some rare cases, event pass from next meeting to current meeting in late. If the occurence of this problem is annoying, decrease datasource/refresh time to workaround
#### **NOTE FOR CSS CLASS**
- CSS file need to be configure to suport CSS class 
	- (if required double check relative path of picture in theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css)
	- rename if required the .cusClass1 into the name you want
	- choose API inside 
		- background-image or background-color		
		- Note: CSS is compliant with Mozilla CSS background API (W3C) 
			- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background
				- background-image
				- background-position
				- background-size
				- background-repeat
				- background-origin
				- background-clip
				- background-attachment
				- background-color
	- for example:  
     	- The file theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css is situated in a sub-directory *css* (./css/theme_sm.css)
     	- The file background picture is situated in a sub-directory *images* (./images/diagonal3.png)	  
      	- Relative path has to be in this case 
	      	- ```background-image: url("../images/diagonal3.png");```
	      	   (go up to CSS file parent directory and then go to *images* directory
- Match SignMeeting *device/edit/CSS class* value with a value of your theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css
	- for example, when ```.cusClass1``` is present on theme_css_generic-V1.10.12.css
		- enter ```cusClass1``` in *device/edit/CSS class* field
- Add the required media *./images/diagonal3.png* in Screen Composer manifest (*medias* tab)
