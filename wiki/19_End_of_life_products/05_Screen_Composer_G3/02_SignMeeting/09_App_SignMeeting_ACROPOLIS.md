#### **NOTE FOR LDAP ATTRIBUTE VALIDITY**
- In case the attribute is not found in LDAP (for example in case tipo error), the condition is considered as fully filled meaning that the RFID badge account is valid
#### **NOTE TO TEST YOUR LDAP WITH GEKKOTA-DESKTOP**
- It is possible to test your LDAP configuration (search filtering by entity type, RFID badge, ...) with Gekkota-desktop. Please refer to Gekkota application notes *Test Your LDAP configuration*

- RFID badge modulation and baudrate can be displayed with diagnoctic mode with Gekkota_os 3.12.25 (or above).
