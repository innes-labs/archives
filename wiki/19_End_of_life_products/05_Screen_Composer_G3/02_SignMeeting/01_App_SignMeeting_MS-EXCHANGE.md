# SignMeeting MS-EXCHANGE
*RELEASE NOTE*
    
**After October 2020, any new or inactive tenants of MS-Exchange Online will have Basic Authentication disabled by default. In the second half of 2021, active MS-Exchange Online users will have Basic Authentication disabled. In both cases, the authentication will be replaced by the OAuth authentication. That implies to create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application for your SignMeeting Appi then enter the three required values resulting from the application creation in the SignMeeting form (V1.13.11 or above) meaning: the application (client) ID value, the client secret value and the tenant ID value. For further information, refer to the SignMeeting user manual.**

##`2021-01-13` V1.13.11  
>##### **IMPORTANT**
- For users having existing `SignMeeting` projects in the previous version `SignMeeting 1.12.XX`,

    - To complete the migration, **edit the SignMeeting's form** as usual. Save the form by pressing on the `Finish` button and close the form.

        - In case the version is still 1.12.XX, go in the Screen Composer menu ```Settings > Preferences > Project and App``` and click on the App version ```Upgrade``` button. For further information, contact support@innes.pro

In case your script is not available here, contact support@innes.pro to get the custom script in the new version 1.13.XX.
