- Add *deny* icon when ACL is denied to modify a multimedia sequence of a calendar event
- Add support of variable in path file name of remote file (or remote directory) in manifest
- Add media behaviour option ```while and not more than XXh-YYm-ZZs``` (```pendant au plus XXh-YYm-ZZs```) for URI, playlist and playfolder 
	- can be activated only when played n times (1X, 2X, ...)
- Add possibility to import default fonts of type ```fira``` (embedded in PlugnCast server file system)
	- the fira fonts are potentially mixed with those imported from OS file system
- Add support of variable in flash var (media behaviour)
- Add tooltip (containing planning summary) for planned task (standby, reboot player)
- Add tooltip (containing path file name) for library resource
- Change: last used domain is loaded by default when logging in to PlugnCast
- Change: Update file or folder paths used by URI or playfolder files. When a file or a path file is renamed in file system Windows or through PlugnCast library, the dependencies path file names are rightly updated (URI with variable)
 	- Note: old media previously created could not inherit of this change. In case working with old URI with variable, renaming a directory or a file could still lead to inconsistent linked media. So it is recommended to still check consistancy of linked media for *old* URI
- Change: remove support of variable of type 
	- ```int```
	- ```float```
	- ```boolean```
	- ```string```
	- ```date```
	- when this version is installed, a specific migration script is launched to transtype the variables
		-   ```int``` to ```localisé``` 
		-   ```float``` to ```localisé``` 
		-   ```boolean``` to ```localisé```
- Change: playfolder creation can now support
	- automatically *folder creation* (as an option) 
		- using of localized variable (as an option)
- Change: the building of URI is done by an easy drag'n drop of the resource from library (media with its path file name or variable)
	- Note: it is possible to drag the resource each other inside URI
- Change: free text is not supported for URI and playfolder
	- note: free text is still supported for URL
		- ex: http://www.innes.pro/{$custom:lang}/support
- Change: mandatory slash character is added in path file name at the back of each variable each time a new one is dropped
	- ex for playfolder 
		- ```[Référentiel du domaine]/{$custom:localized}/{$deviceInfo:field1}/```
	- ex for URI  
		- ```[Référentiel du domaine]/URI/{$deviceInfo:field1}/{$custom:filename3}```
		- ```[Référentiel partagé]/{ $custom:var_localized}/{$deviceInfo:field1}/{$custom:var_filename}.jpg```
- Change: playfolder can now be only made of 
	- resource domain repository
	- resource directories
	- resource variables
		- ```localisé```
		- ```device info```
		- ```xpath```
	- note: ```texte``` and ```json``` variables cannot be used in playfolder
	- note: in case a URI contains a variable which can not be resolved in preview (because the variable does not exist anymore, or contains non value), the variable color inside the URI becomes orange
- Change: URI can now be only made of
	- resource domain repository directory
	- resource directories 
	- resource variables 
		- ```localisé``` (file extension selection is proposed when URI is finishing with localized variable)
		- ```device info``` (file extension selection is proposed when URI is finishing with device info variable)
		- ```xpath``` (file extension selection is proposed when URI is finishing with xpath variable)
		- ```nom de fichier``` (file extension selection is not proposed because the variable is embedding already an extension)
			- when a variable ```nom de fichier``` is used in URI pathfile name, it can be put only at the end of URI
			- when another variable ```nom de fichier``` is used in URI pathfile name, it replaces the previous one
	- note: ```texte``` and ```json``` variables can not be used in URI
- Change: manual adding of dependencies in linked file are not required anymore when creating playfolder with variable (or URI with variable) except when using xpath.
	- note for legacy playfolder/URI: due to variable using, some medias manually inserted in linked media tab should remain. These ones will not follow properly their automatic file renaming (or directory renaming). Consequently, they could cause publication or downloading error. To solve the issue review all the URI and playfolder and delete all the linked media related to the variable resolution (except when using xpath variable)
	- when xpath variable is used, a reminder message is displayed showing that the a medias (target media with variable xpath resolved) need to be inserted in linked media 
	- when device info variable is used, the target filename can be resolved automatically only when the device info variable values has been imported from the player in PlugnCast (Library/Variable view). Otherwise the target file must be inserted in linked medias of the URI or playfolder 
- Change: resource owner name is set each time a new resource (file, directory, playout, channel) is created
	- note: superadmin is set as owner for old resource previously created
- Change icon for ACL and Roles
- Change: default value  for tolerance duration is now 1 minute
- Change: cancel purge task when a publication task is launched (and reciprocally)
- Change: add 2 tab for frontal: *devices* and *properties* (settings/domains/frontal view)
- Change: SlideMaker is using now PlugnCast fonts instead of the 11 previous fonts (the previous fonts are not supported anymore and are transtyped to *default* font)
- Change: message "internet explorer is not supported" 
- Change: empty player label is not supported anymore
- Change: media in layout is not supported anymore for audio zone
- Change: not possible anymore to use user interface when LDAP test is running
- Change: display frontal type in settings/frontal
- Change: default behaviour duration for a MS-Powerpoint media is 10 seconds (instead 1X)
- Change: message *Adobe Flash Player plugin is required*
- Change: standby task start time and end time can not have the same value
- Fix: sometimes when inserted in calendar, a new event could have a intrinsic duration larger than the one showed in the screen leading to unexpected conflict when editing the event or leading to problem to increase event duration by a drag'n drop
	- note: in case still facing problems with some events created before this version, delete and create again the event
- Fix: in some case, reboot and standby tasks were not starting at the right time (jet lag not taken into account)
- Fix: players with a device status containing "{" due to a script download error can be detected by PlugnCast (domain/frontal)
- Fix: message *Error: the file has not been locked: please retry* when importing file with large size (300MB or above)
- Fix: upload screen could not be closed when server is rebooting in the middle of uploading
- Fix: in some case, the Target/System screen was not computing the right available space on disk storage
- Fix: in some case, players list was not displayed in setting/frontal screen
- Fix: playfolder background color was not taken into account
- Fix: in some case, manifest could raise inconsistent anomaly when a playlist was updated
- Fix: publication issue *nslMIMEService.getTypeFromExtension*

- Fix: firmware named with mention *beta* was not properly sorted in alphabetic order
- Fix: URI do not work if the file extension is in upper case.
- Fix LDAP user filtering could make crash the server (Linux)
	Note: for filtering replace filter: ```(&(objectClass==user)(mail=*innes.pro) by filter [Avancé ] ```(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)```
- Fix: volume icon was following the real volume threshold (video media preview)
- Fix: sometimes some of the players could not be properly sorted in alphabetic order

	- It is not possible to return back to previous version of PlugnCast working properly due to compatibility break inserted on the data model in this version (task management, default variables management, playlists and playfolders using shared repository). For that reason, you should save the PlugnCast file system in order to be able to return back to 3.10.19    
	- In order to activate player software release through PlugnCast G3, a special configuration on players has to be done. Please see release notes below

		- connect to each WebUI player, and configure the 'Softwares update and installation server' section. Url should be like that : ```https://<machine_IP>/.frontals/.webdav/<domaine>/.setup/```
