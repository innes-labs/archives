- It is required to install once, for each `Qeedji System AOSP 9` device, the *Playzilla APK* (4.13.13 or above) to make the initial connection to the `PlugnCast Server 3.12.18` (and above). Once installed, the form of the *Playzilla* APK allows to:  
	- set the *PlugnCast* frontal URL

#### **LG WebOS Signage 3.0 / LG WebOS Signage 3.2 / LG WebOS Signage 4.0 / LG WebOS Signage 4.1**
- For any rendering issue or 
-  decoding issue with LG WebOS Signage smart monitors, it is advised to read first the monitor user manual and check your smart monitor capabilities 
- About MS-PowerPoint or PDF
    - If ever your smart monitor could support PDF and MS-PowerPoint medias with a recent firmware version, the message *content temporarily unavailable* is displayed when trying to play these kinds of medias anyway  
- About video 
    - in some rare cases, after having played a interlaced video, the video viewport can be split into 2 parts horizontally. One of the 2 parts is displaying the last decoded video picture
- Dual video decoding 
    - on `LG WebOS Signage 3.0` and `LG WebOS Signage 4.0` smart monitors, the dual video decoding may be not supported properly leading to a black screen in one of the two zones. The following medias in this zone cannot be played anymore. To work around, do only play one video media at a time.
- About software upgrade
    - on `LG WebOS Signage 3.0` smart monitors, in case OS upgrade through `PlugnCast Server`, in some rare case, the `Playzilla` App could be stuck on a specific media. Consequently the smart monitor cannot finalize the software upgrade. To work around, press on the `Exit` key of the monitor remote control to close the `Playzilla` App. Then press on the `URL launcher` menu to launch again the `Playzilla` App
- About SlideMaker
    - In case issue to play an old SlideMaker media on `LG WebOS Signage` smart monitor, edit the SlideMaker media again to upgrade it and publish again
- Automatic update for remote file or remote directory is not supported
- `smb://` scheme is not supported and may prevent publication to work properly
- Some script to execute may not work because some of them require some feature not supported by the OS
#### **SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 4 / SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 5 / SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 6**
- For any rendering issues or video decoding issue with `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP4/SSSP5/SSSP6` smart monitors, it is advised to read first your `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP` user manual 
    - [Example of SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 5 release note](https://displaysolutions.samsung.com/pdf/manual/3336/DBJ_QBH_QHH_QMH_EU_WebManual_Eng_for_Europe-03_20180801.0.pdf)
- About MS-PowerPoint or PDF
   - Due to issues noticed regarding the duration per page on SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP smart monitors when playing PDF or MS-PowerPoint medias, the message *content temporarily unavailable* is now displayed when trying to play these kinds of medias    
- About SlideMaker
    - In case issue to play an old SlideMaker media on `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP` smart monitor, edit the SlideMaker media again to upgrade it and publish again   
- About video
   - Video container 
      - To support the video media, the `Playzilla` App uses the W3C ```HTML5 <video> element``` implemented by SAMSUNG. Consequently, if the implementation is not completed on the `SSSP` Tizen smart monitors for all the container types, some of them may be not supported
         - examples of container which could be not supported: ```.mpg, .m2v, .mov, .mkv, .asf, .vob, .avi, .wmv``` on `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 4` and `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 5`   
         - examples of container which could be not supported: ```.m2v, .mov, .mkv, .asf, .avi, .wmv``` on `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 6`
   - On the `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 5` smart monitors, playing two video medias at a same time may leads to unexpected behaviour; for example video which is stopping forever with a black screen displayed. To work around, do only play one video media at a time 
   - Playing one audio channel and one audio-video channel at a same time may lead to unexpected behaviour (video which is stopping forever). To work around, do not play an audio channel at the same time. These limitation occurs even when the video media has no audio track.
   - Video media inside a Web page 
       - On the `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 4` smart monitors, the video media inside a Web page, could not start or lead to a video decoder dead lock ending by displaying forever the last decoded picture of the video media. No more video can be played afterwards. The `Playzilla` information message *content temporarily unavailable* is not displayed in this case.
     - On the `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 4` smart monitors, it is possible that the video is started and played properly only one time of two when alternated with an image. To work around it is possible to play the video inside a Web page using the widget `video_subtitle.wgt`. For further information on this widget, contact support@innes.pro
     - A secondary video played inside a hidden zone at the same time as another video may appear jerky as it should not appear at all         
- About Web page 
    - Some Web page supported on Gekkota devices may be not supported on SSSP smart monitors
    - Some Web pages requiring a lot of memory resource could lead to the `Playzilla` App closing. To work around, remove from the content the Web page causing the App failure and publish. Launch again the `Playzilla` App     
- About Display orientation 
       - The `Display orientation` menu may be greyed (available from the menu `onScreen display`) when the `Playzilla` App is running. To access again to this `Display orientation` menu, close the `Playzilla` App by pressing on the `EXIT` key of the monitor remote control. Change the `Display orientation` to *Portrait* or *Landscape*. Once done, launch again the `Playzilla` App with the menu `URL launcher`.  
- About UDP streaming
    - On `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP` smart monitors, the video playback through UDP is not supported
- About firmware upgrade/downgrade
    - The software downgrade is not supported on `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP` smart monitors.
    - on  `SAMSUNG Tizen SSSP 4` smart monitors, in case the firmware is upgraded with PlugnCast server, in some rare case, the `Playzilla` App could stay stuck on a specific media. Consequently the smart monitor cannot finalize the software upgrade. To work around, press on the `Exit` key of the monitor remote control to close the `Playzilla` App. Once done, launch again the `Playzilla` App with the menu `URL launcher`
- Automatic update for remote file or remote directory is not supported
- `smb://` scheme is not supported and may prevent publication to work properly
